        - [~] mapped prediction / couldn't test with predictions of more than one class

- [ ] 2 main struggle points:
    - [ ] MAPPING SHOULD HOLD TRUE OVER TIME
    - [ ] PROPERLY TESTING THE EMERGENCE OF NEW REGIMES

- [x] FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE TEST DATA THAT RESULTS IN REPEATABLE OUTCOMES
    - this was in response to weird outcomes using earthquake data
	  which turns out to be a numpy compatibility issue
    - just downgraded np

        - [x] keeping number of regimes
        - [x] adding regime
    - [x] computing transition threshold
        - [x] too little values
	    - [x] less than 8 values
        - [x] enough values
        - [x] setting and getting

	- [x] self.config works
    - **function tests**
        - [~] right regime detection

        - [ ] predict
            - [x] mapper is set
            - [x] mapper is correct
            - [ ] mapping is constant over many models
        - [ ] new regime
        - [ ] regime disappearing?
- [x] handle cost matrix being infeasible
    - an entire col being inf
- [x] ! train multiple models and use cheapest one
- [x] silhouette vs bic
    - bic tries to maximize number of regimes during initial fit
    - changing from bic to silhouette min fit makes no difference
- [ ] scores over time
        - [ ] bic
        - [ ] aic
        - [ ] silhouette
- [ ] should really be indexed on last saturday of month
- [ ] serialize all instruments for M20
    - do other ones later one
    - ~2 hours per
- [ ] tests for time index
- [ ] test for predict all
